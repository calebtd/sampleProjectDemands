1. Create a new repository or use the one we made in class on tuesday for the SampleProject. Send this public repository to Bryce.
2. Create a .gitignore and ignore the following _.blah, _.nfo, \*.DS_Store.
3. Create the following branches: develop, feature/<yourname>, accept, uat.
4. Create around ~50 commits you would be prod to discuss in an interview. Update the files and folders in the SampleProject structure to reflect a real world website. (if you are new to html/css, copy what I posted and start updating it, I will help you.) If you are still stuck letâ€™s get some other exercises for you to work on.
5. Update the README.MD with notes on your repo. How to get stated, how to run it or anything else I need to know to grade it.
6. Publish on gitpages and send Bryce the url.
