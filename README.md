No running is necessary, GitHub pages hosts it.

I didn't get as many commits as I would hope, however I figured a lot of things out with this project. Branching is super cool, it just takes some messing around to figure it all out.
I may keep adding to this, we'll see. I'm goint to start focusing on the project on Canvas. Thanks for the template files!
